# Nested Commenting System (Frontend)

A **React frontend** implementation of a nested commenting system, designed to visually represent hierarchical comment threads for a single post. This project focuses on **UI and interaction**â€”allowing users to view comments, replies, and upvotes, as well as collapse and expand threads.  

Note: This project currently only implements the frontend. Backend functionality (storing or fetching comments) is not included.

## Problem Statement

Nested commenting systems are central to many interactive digital platforms, providing structured discussions, knowledge exchange, and community engagement. The goal of this project is to create a **fully functional commenting interface** that:

- Displays a single post (image, article, or placeholder text).
- Shows **top-level comments** directly under the post.
- Supports **replies to any comment**, forming multiple hierarchical levels.
- Allows **upvoting** to indicate popularity or relevance.
- Lets users **collapse or expand comment threads** for better readability.

## Features

- React-based frontend with modular components.
- Nested comments with unlimited levels of replies.
- **Upvote and Downvote functionality** for comments.
- **Sorting** by number of upvotes or newest.
- **Special admin user** privileges (like deleting comments).
- Collapse/expand threads for better navigation.
- Clean and intuitive UI using **Material-UI**.
- Animations and transitions using **Framer Motion**.
- UUID-based unique identifiers for comments and replies.
- includes a about me page.
